:::info Spoilers
There are spoilers ahead for Ted Lasso Season 2. If you have not watched it - and don't want the story to be exposed - don't read this yet.
:::

Personally, I was _uninterested_ in starting Ted Lasso season two. Ted, with his smile, can-do attitude, and tenacity to "never give up". How can he stay so dang optimistic?! (_Hats off to Jason Sudeikis for his acting. It's like he was born to play this role._)

Admittedly, I was reluctant because I didn't think I was quite ready to handle the emotional toll I knew the show would bring. But with most things "show related" in our home, I let the chips fall where they may as my wife hit "play" on the remote. I offered up the sentiment that I wasn't ready to watch the show - but I also told her I didn't know if I would ever be ready. And just like that, our lives hinged on the binge!

I started doing dishes and other tasks in an attempt to avoid all direct contact with the TV, knowing if I payed attention I'd get sucked right in. Of course, by the first half of episode one, I found myself right back in the drivers seat (_couch in this case_) with a giddy little smile on my face. There they were - the folks I grew to admire so much after this show seemingly came out of nowhere in a time where everyone really needed it. And who other than Roy **fuc&!n6** Kent, to pull me in.

> Roy allows that Rebecca's date is "fine," but adds that "it's not about him. It's about why the f\*\*\* you think he deserves you." Taken aback by both Roy's passion and the implied high regard in which he holds her, it doesn't take Rebecca long to, while listening to "Wise Up" (a clever callback to an earlier Magnolia joke), realize Roy is right.

This small - but oh so important gesture - not only sets the tone for their relationship in the show - it shows how friends who truly value their relationships have honest; helpful; and supportive conversations with each other. In other words **communication**!

Looking back on my thoughts prior to starting season two, and how I feel now having watched it, **I was right to be leary in the face of emotional turmoil!**... as season two has plenty of it. But I was pleasantly surprised to find that I was wrong in feeling I didn't need it. It was just the opposite in fact. The complexity of this season's social situations provides perspective of how navigating life is relatively the same for all of us. In the end, we collectively yearn for connection, kinship, and understanding.

This season approaches a lot of difficult to discuss topics like anxiety; depression; panic attacks; how to speak with mental health professionals; breaking down the societal barriers of therapy; being a dad; feminism; being a female in the workplace; the complicated nature of adult friendships; great parenting advice; the list goes on and on. And yet, with so many different scenarios to focus on, the moment that I'd like to hone in on is the photo-shoot with Keeley and Roy.

While this moment itself became the pinnacle of "what's going to happen next" (for me at least), let's provide some context before diving in.

:::info Spoilers
Last warning! Providing context will require some information from Season 1. Turn back now or forever know some things that happened!
:::

## The Setup

We spent all last season rooting for Roy and Keeley to get together. Tartt was being, well, a [tart](https://www.insultopedia.org/dictionary/tart/) (as they well showed on Jamie island - "leaving Man City" edition)! We spent countless hours cheering against Jamie, and hoping Roy finds some solace after his life is inevitably changed forever.

At least we open up with these two in a solid relationship to start the season. We don't have to go through the whole:

> "oh no - we need some drama - let's make some unnecessary in-fighting between the stable romantic interest - because stability would be CRAZY!"
>
> \- Network Producers Somewhere Probably

This was an important sticking point for me, because it allows the viewer comfort where there otherwise isn't. Emotional turbulence throughout a show isn't usually a problem if you have a rock that you can anchor yourself to. TL2 (Ted Lasso Season 2) made early nods that we could hook our anchors to these two and we'd be "safe". Because no matter what, we have "Roy and Keeley" right?

Again, its hard to focus on just one facet of the show because there are so many great aspects of season two that deserve their own post. Whats more, is that the writers found a way to connect all of these feelings and emotions to relevant situations in the characters lives, as well as those watching. In those connections - we find the subtle nuance of Roy and Keeley's relationship.

### Space

The first little tussle we see our lovers get into is over _"space"_. Roy comes to work for Richmond, where Keeley is also working, and that ends up being a bit of a problem. Keeley is clearly getting smothered and unable to find a moment of peace to herself. Keeley confides in her friends, and eventually coworkers, because she is so flustered by the problem but clearly doesn't want to hurt Roy.

We see that Keeley's peak frustration hit when Roy rants and raves about his book while _Sex and the City_, the whole reason Keeley is even in the living room, is playing in the background.

Keeley, at this point understandably _"freaks out"_.

I think that this situation is one we may have likely all found ourselves in. If you've ever been sat next to a movie talker, you'll know the true inner loathing that Keeley felt at this point (_"SHUT. UP. ... I'M TRYING TO WATCH THIS!"_).

The setup for this scenario, and the overall execution of the "fight", is so impactful because it speaks directly to our human nature. Keeley wants nothing more than to be loved by, and love, her partner. Instead of potentially hurting his feelings by asking him to back off, she speaks with Rebecca, and eventually "coworkers/friends".

This is something I personally have done in my life countless times. But not because you want to highlight the other persons short-comings but simply because you're working through how to approach this situation yourself. Not to mention - hearing others perspectives on how they may have handled similar situations in their lives can offer perspective (whether or not you use that same approach).

Its somewhat of a catch 22 of connectivity. You're offering up a piece of your life, that will undoubtedly make you vulnerable. By offering up this information to others, you're entering into a social contract. These conversations are what lead us to connect with others, to sympathize and empathize. This information, however, can also place someone else in a position where they are unable to speak for themselves (one of the points that TL2 ends up making).

_During Keeley and Roy's first fight of the show - we get a look into what its like to love someone so deeply and yet still somehow be mad at them._

**TL;DW**

- Keeley needs some space to be a person
- Roy feels like a jerk because people may now view him as "clingy" (which goes against his personal brand)

By avoiding the hard conversation with Roy and instead trying to "outsource" her problem solving, Keeley has now unintentionally made the "issue" worse. None of this is, of course, a blame game. Keeley is well within reason in needing some space and time for her own. What this shows us though - is that instead of going straight to others - we should be able to approach our partners with issues we have about our relationship.

This is what excites me specifically about this couple and how they were written on TL2. This is seriously complex human emotion at its finest, in the stickiest of situations ... "relationships". On the one hand, Keeley is now closer to Rebecca and her co-workers. On the other hand, it came at the potential expense of another's social appearance. All of which would have been solved by just going directly to the person that the issue was with in the first place.

It also shows how you can genuinely love someone so deeply - but that doesn't mean everything has to be "perfect all the time". Relationships are work - they don't just start and remain "perfect". Things change, humans change, hell even relationships we're in change. And that's kind of the point of all of it - its complicated.

Roy of course realizes he's been a bit of a burden and drew an amazingly relaxing looking bath, with a music from the hilarious playlist name "Roy's sorry for not understanding Keeley".

While this is the icing on the cake, I think its fantastic that they actually showed it. The writers could have swept it under the rug - or simply stated
"yeah we made up" or "we're over it". But this is what makes the relationships of Ted Lasso so unexpectedly real... we see it all. We see the nitty gritty fight between new lovers, and we see them make up like reasonable humans with healthy relationships.

Boundaries are a critical part of any relationship. Defining those boundaries, while still showing that you truly love someone can be incredibly difficult. Sometimes it can even cause more of a rift than we may have thought it was worth. Yet if we don't tell people what we need from them - we build up resentments that intoxicate our relationship with doubt from within. Working through communicating boundaries, as Roy and Keeley show us, isn't easy but it is well worth it.

:::tip Fun Fact
[According to "The Dipp"](https://thedipp.com/ted-lasso/sex-and-the-city-reference-keeley-roy)

> Keeley wants to watch her Sex and the City in peace. And it just so happens that the episode she's watching — "The Good Fight" — is speaking directly to her experience with Roy. Aidan has moved into Carrie's apartment in this truly iconic Season 4 episode (sure, every SATC episode is "iconic," but Sarah Jessica Parker and John Corbett's performances in this one are pure perfection). Aidan's incessant check-ins are driving Carrie a little bonkers. She wants to walk in without being bombarded ("He's all up in my face with, 'Who'd you see? Where'd you go? Who'd ya meet? What do ya know?'") and engage in "secret single behavior" (S.S.B.). It all comes to a head when Aidan suggests they clean out her closet to make space for his stuff.

### Honesty

... is one of the most difficult topics to approach in any relationship. You can't have a relationship, well at least a healthy one, without the truth. Whats difficult about "honesty" is, ironically, how honest one should be with another person.

Let's take the age old "there is something in your teeth" "problem" (its no trolly car problem - but it does come up in real life far more often).

> \*Ted walks into a diamond dog rally after having lunch at the nearest kebab shop.
>
> \*Ted has a huge chunk of leafy green stuck in-between his teeth.

_Whats next? How do we tell Ted he has something in his teeth without being rude or drawing attention to it? Is it embarrassing if we say something out loud? What if we don't say something? Will he look more foolish standing up there in front of everyone with something in his teeth?_

I admit - most of the above puts the individual in a ["bystander effect"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect) situation, and our example is far more intimate than that of a bystander. That being said - I think it illustrates how even the most simple communication creates a complex decision tree that we have to, at least partially, resolve prior to acting on our thoughts (or not acting on them - for that matter).

Unfortunately - I have no good answer for you to the above question. The crux of why we can't answer the question really comes down to social and societal, normalizations, as well as ones personal upbringing (nature via nurture and all that). But that's okay - because we don't need an answer to the question - what we can see is simply that "honesty" is difficult.

In this paradox, we would like to be wholely and completely honest with someone to foster _the most_ meaningful relationship we can, while also not hurting that person because we care so deeply for. Herein lies the beauty of what the Ted Lasso writers were able to weave into Roy and Keeley's tapestry.
